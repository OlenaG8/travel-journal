        description: `This almost 8-kilometre path near Malaga was once considered one of the most dangerous in the world. 
            Today the entire route has been carefully restored, but although it's now much safer, one thing hasn't changed 
            - the unique experience of strolling along walkways hanging over 100 metres up on a sheer cliff face. 
            The views are unforgettable. `,
